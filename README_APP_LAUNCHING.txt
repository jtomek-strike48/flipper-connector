⚠️ CRITICAL: App Launching Behavior

If using AppStart to launch Flipper apps:

1. App will display on Flipper screen ✅
2. Flipper becomes FROZEN - buttons don't work ❌  
3. Cannot exit via RPC - must manually intervene ❌

TO EXIT:
- Disconnect RPC (unplug USB)
- Press physical Back button on Flipper
- Reconnect if needed

This is a security feature, not a bug.
See IMPORTANT_APP_LAUNCHING_BEHAVIOR.md for full details.
